# useless-barchart

A completely useless barchart. </br>
Even though the chart itself is responsive </br>
but you cant really use the chart because the man at bottom right corner will try to block you. </br>
Brings no value but fun(?) to user. </br>
</br>
Try the Christmas edition too, Merry Christmas!
